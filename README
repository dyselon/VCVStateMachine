A module to help implement finite state machines in VCV Rack. Currently, there is only a single module implementing a markov chain node. I intend to expand it out to a toolkit of generic and specific fsm modules, and I will may try a couple of different UI variations on the same modules.

Markov State
------------
Represents a single node in a markov chain. When active, it passes its signal input through to its signal output. When advanced, it becomes inactive, and randomly triggers one of the following states.
